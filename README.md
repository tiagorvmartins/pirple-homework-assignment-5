This is my public repo for the Pirple Homework Assignment #5

This is a simple project in order to prepare a simple test runner for a few basic functions, like getting a random number or checking if a string is a palindrome.

There is unit tests for the following library functions:

##### sumBetweenNumbers
##### returnLenghtOfString
##### generateRandomNumberBetweenZeroAndTen
##### generateRandomNumberBetweenZeroAndOneHundred
##### generateRandomNumberBetweenZeroAndArgument
##### checkStringIsPalindrome
